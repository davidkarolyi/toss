# toss

A minimal CLI for deploying apps to a VPS with automatic preview environments.

## Philosophy

- No Docker
- No Kubernetes
- No complex configuration
- Single VPS
- Git-based workflow
- Convention over configuration
- Runtime-agnostic

## Installation

```bash
curl -fsSL https://toss.dev/install.sh | sh
```

## Commands

```bash
toss init                              # interactive setup wizard (local + VPS)
toss deploy <env>                      # deploy to environment (e.g., prod, pr-42)
toss deploy <env> -s KEY=VALUE         # deploy with per-environment secret override
toss rollback <env> [release]          # roll back to previous or specific release
toss remove <env>                      # remove an environment (prod cannot be removed)
toss list                              # list running deployments
toss status                            # status summary (config + deployments + overrides)
toss logs <env>                        # tail logs for environment
toss logs <env> -n 100                 # show last 100 lines
toss logs <env> --since "1h"           # logs since time (e.g., 1h, 2025-01-01)
toss logs <env> -n 100 --follow        # show last 100 lines, then follow
toss ssh <env>                         # SSH into server, cd to current release directory
toss secrets push <env> --file <file>  # push secrets (env: prod or preview)
toss secrets pull <env> [--file <file>]# pull secrets from VPS (defaults to .env.prod/.env.preview)
```

All commands require explicit arguments—no defaults. This keeps deployments predictable.

### Rollbacks

toss keeps old releases on the server for prod environments (default: 3 releases, configurable via `keepReleases`).

**Quick rollback** (instant, uses existing release on server):
```bash
toss rollback prod
# You will be prompted to select a release.
# Or specify a release directly:
toss rollback prod 20260130_100000
```

This swaps the `current` symlink and restarts the service. Quick rollback
works when multiple releases are available (prod keeps several by default;
previews typically keep only one).

**Manual rollback** (SSH, same effect as toss rollback):
```bash
ssh root@64.23.123.45
cd /srv/myapp/prod/releases
ls -la  # see available releases
ln -sfn /srv/myapp/prod/releases/20260130_100000 /srv/myapp/prod/current
systemctl restart toss-myapp-prod
```

**Full rollback** (deploys from your local repo):
```bash
git checkout abc123f
toss deploy prod
```

The quick rollback is instant but requires SSH access. The full rollback creates a new release from your local code.

## Config File

`toss.json` in repo root:

```json
{
  "app": "myapp",
  "server": "root@64.23.123.45",
  "domain": "example.com",
  "startCommand": "npm start",
  "deployScript": [
    "npm ci",
    "npm run build"
  ],
  "dependencies": {
    "nodejs": "curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_20.x | bash - && apt-get install -y nodejs",
    "bun": "curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash"
  },
  "persistentDirs": ["./data", "uploads"],
  "keepReleases": 5
}
```

Fields:
- `app` (required): app name (used for directories and service names)
- `server` (required): SSH target (e.g., `root@64.23.123.45`, `root@64.23.123.45:2222`, or IPv6 `root@[::1]:2222`)
- `domain` (optional): public domain; if omitted, toss uses sslip.io URLs (e.g., `prod.myapp.64-23-123-45.sslip.io`)
- `startCommand` (required): command to start the app (used in systemd unit file)
- `deployScript` (required): array of commands run on every deploy
- `dependencies` (optional): named install commands that run once per server (toss tracks what was applied)
- `persistentDirs` (optional): array of directories that persist across releases (e.g., `data`, `uploads`) — legacy `preserve` is still accepted
- `keepReleases` (optional): number of old releases to keep for prod (default: 3); previews always keep only the current release

`app` and `domain` are independent; toss does not derive one from the other.
There is no local `.toss/` folder; all config lives in `toss.json`. Server state is stored in `/srv/<app>/.toss/`.

## Environment Naming Rules

- Lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens only (`a-z`, `0-9`, `-`)
- Must start with a letter
- Max 63 characters (DNS label safe)
- `prod` is reserved for the prod environment
- `production` is not supported; use `prod`

## Directory Structure on Server

```
/srv/myapp/
├── .toss/

    ├── current -> releases/20260130_160000
    └── preserve/
```

All toss-managed state lives in `.toss/`. Each environment has:
- `releases/` - timestamped release directories (e.g., `20260130_143022`)
- `current` - symlink pointing to the active release
- `preserve/` - directories that persist across deployments (configured via `persistentDirs` in toss.json)

The `current` symlink is swapped atomically on each deploy, so the transition between releases is instantaneous.

### State File

`.toss/state.json` tracks ports, dependencies, deployment lock, and project origin:

```json
{
  "origin": "git@github.com:user/myapp.git",
  "deployments": {
    "prod": { "port": 3000 },
    "pr-42": { "port": 3001 }
  },
  "appliedDependencies": ["nodejs", "bun"],
  "lock": null
}
```

The `origin` field stores the git remote URL from the first init. On subsequent deploys, toss verifies the origin matches to prevent accidental overwrites from different projects with the same app name.

The `lock` field prevents concurrent deploys (see Deployment Locking).

## Deploy Commands (deployScript)

Commands that run on every deploy are stored in `toss.json` under `deployScript`.
They run after files are synced and secrets are copied.

```bash
npm ci
npm run build
# npm run db:migrate
# npm run db:seed
```

## Server Setup and Dependencies

The optional `dependencies` config field controls server-wide setup:

- `dependencies`: named install commands that run once per server, before deploys we make sure all dependencies are installed.

toss records which dependencies have already been applied on the server, so they
do not re-run on every deploy.

## Persistent Directories

The `persistentDirs` config field specifies directories that should persist across releases. On each deploy:

1. toss creates the release directory with a timestamp (e.g., `20260130_143022`)
2. For each path in `persistentDirs`:
   - Ensures the directory exists under `preserve/`
   - Creates a symlink from the release to `preserve/` (e.g., `releases/20260130_143022/uploads → ../preserve/uploads`)

This keeps user uploads, SQLite databases, or other persistent data safe across deploys. Put files (like `data/db.sqlite`) inside one of these directories so all SQLite sidecar files stay together.

```json
{
  "persistentDirs": ["./data", "uploads", "var/cache"]
}
```

Rules for persistentDirs:
- Must be relative paths (no leading `/`)
- Cannot contain `..` segments
- Nested paths are supported (e.g., `var/cache`)
Legacy aliases `preserve` and `persistantDirs` are accepted but deprecated.

## Release Cleanup

After each successful deploy, toss cleans up old releases:

- **Prod**: Keeps the most recent N releases (where N is `keepReleases`, default 3). This allows quick rollbacks by manually switching the `current` symlink.
- **Previews**: Only keeps the current release. Preview environments are temporary and don't need rollback capability.

Old releases are deleted only after the new release is fully active (symlink switched, service restarted).

## Environment Variables

Available in `deployScript` commands (secrets are also injected):

| Variable           | Description                         | Example                                    |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `TOSS_ENV`         | Environment name                    | `prod`, `pr-42`                      |
| `TOSS_APP`         | App name from config                | `myapp`                                    |
| `TOSS_PORT`        | Assigned port                       | `3000`, `3001`                             |
| `TOSS_RELEASE_DIR` | This release's timestamped dir      | `/srv/myapp/pr-42/releases/20260130_143022`|
| `TOSS_ENV_DIR`     | Environment's base directory        | `/srv/myapp/pr-42`                         |
| `TOSS_PROD_DIR`    | Prod's current directory            | `/srv/myapp/prod/current`            |

User secrets from the secrets file are also injected into the environment.

Note: `TOSS_RELEASE_DIR` points to the actual timestamped release directory being deployed, while `TOSS_ENV_DIR` points to the environment's base directory (containing `releases/`, `current`, and `preserve/`). `TOSS_PROD_DIR` always points to prod's `current` symlink, useful for referencing prod assets from preview environments.

## Port Assignment

Ports are assigned dynamically starting from 3000:

1. On deploy, read `.toss/state.json` to find ports already assigned by toss
2. Check which ports are actually in use on the server (via `ss -tlnp`)
3. Assign the next available port that is both untracked and unused
4. Update `state.json` before starting systemd service

```
toss-myapp-prod → 3000
toss-myapp-pr-42      → 3001
toss-myapp-pr-17      → 3002
```

This prevents collisions both within toss-managed deployments and with other services on the server.

## Deployment Locking

To prevent race conditions from concurrent deploys, toss uses a lock stored in `state.json`:

```json
{
  "lock": {
    "environment": "pr-42",
    "host": "user@laptop.local",
    "pid": 12345,
    "startedAt": "2024-01-23T10:00:00Z"
  }
}
```

### How It Works

1. Before deploying, toss attempts to acquire a lock
2. If locked by another process, toss checks if the lock is stale:
   - Lock older than 30 minutes → considered stale, can be broken
   - Lock holder process is dead → can be broken
3. If lock is active, deploy fails with a clear message showing who holds it
4. After deploy completes (success or failure), lock is released

### Recovery

If a deploy is interrupted (Ctrl+C, network failure, crash), the lock may remain. The next deploy will:
- Check if the lock is stale (>30 min old)
- Attempt to verify if the locking process is still alive
- Break stale locks automatically
- For fresh locks from a dead process, prompt for manual confirmation

```
⚠ Deploy locked by user@laptop.local (pid 12345) since 10:00:00
  Lock appears stale. Breaking lock and continuing...
```

## Service Names

systemd services are named using a prefix and delimiter:

`toss-<app>-<env>`

For example: `toss-myapp-prod`, `toss-myapp-pr-42`

Service unit files are stored at `/etc/systemd/system/toss-<app>-<env>.service`.

### Example Unit File

```ini
[Unit]
Description=toss-myapp-prod
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
WorkingDirectory=/srv/myapp/prod/current
EnvironmentFile=/srv/myapp/prod/current/.env
ExecStart=npm start
Restart=always
RestartSec=5

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

The `ExecStart` is derived from the `startCommand` in `toss.json`. The `WorkingDirectory` points to `current/` (the symlink), so systemd always runs from the active release.

## Secrets Management

Secrets are stored on the VPS, not in the repository.

### Files on Server

```
/srv/myapp/.toss/secrets/
├── prod.env    # base secrets for prod
├── preview.env       # base secrets for all non-prod environments
└── overrides/
    ├── pr-42.env     # overrides for pr-42 (merged with preview.env)
    └── staging.env   # overrides for staging (merged with preview.env)
```

### Commands

```bash
toss secrets push prod --file .env.local   # push local file as prod secrets
toss secrets push preview --file .env.local      # push local file as preview secrets
toss secrets pull prod --file .env         # download prod secrets to local file
toss secrets pull prod                      # defaults to .env.prod
```

### How It Works

1. Push base secrets once per type using `toss secrets push` (prod or preview)
2. Base secrets are stored at `/srv/<app>/.toss/secrets/<type>.env`
3. On deploy, toss merges base secrets + environment overrides into `.env`
   - Production uses `prod.env` + `overrides/prod.env` (if exists)
   - Non-prod uses `preview.env` + `overrides/<env>.env` (if exists)
   - Overrides take precedence over base secrets

### Per-Environment Overrides

Use the `--secret` / `-s` flag on deploy to set per-environment overrides:

```bash
toss deploy pr-42 --secret DATABASE_URL=postgres://db/pr_42_branch
toss deploy pr-42 -s DATABASE_URL=postgres://db/pr_42 -s DEBUG=true
```

Overrides are **persistent**—they're saved on the server and apply to all future deploys of that environment. To remove an override, set it to empty:

```bash
toss deploy pr-42 -s DEBUG=
```

### Use Case: Per-PR Databases

When each preview needs its own database:

```bash
# Shared preview secrets (API keys, etc.)
toss secrets push preview --file .env.preview

# First deploy of pr-42 with its own database
toss deploy pr-42 -s DATABASE_URL=postgres://db/pr_42_branch

# Subsequent deploys automatically use the saved override
toss deploy pr-42
```

### Team Workflow

1. One team member pushes initial base secrets
2. Other team members pull secrets if needed locally: `toss secrets pull` (defaults to .env.prod/.env.preview)
3. Use `-s KEY=VALUE` on deploy for environment-specific overrides
4. To update base secrets: edit locally, then push again

### CI Setup

CI needs SSH access to the server. Secrets are already on the VPS, so no secret keys needed in CI environment variables.

### Empty Secrets

During init, toss creates empty `prod.env` and `preview.env` files. If you deploy without pushing secrets, toss will warn you:

```
⚠ No secrets found. Your app will start with an empty .env file.
  Push secrets with: toss secrets push prod --file .env.local
```

The deploy continues with an empty `.env` to avoid blocking CI pipelines.

## Init (Interactive Setup)

`toss init` handles everything — local config and VPS provisioning in one interactive flow.

```
$ toss init

┌─────────────────────────────────────┐

1. If you set a domain, add DNS records:
   A  *.myapp.example.com  → 64.23.123.45

2. Add GitHub secrets (Settings → Secrets → Actions):
   SSH_HOST     64.23.123.45
   SSH_USER     root
   SSH_KEY      (contents of ~/.ssh/id_ed25519)

3. Push your secrets:
   toss secrets push prod --file .env.local
   toss secrets push preview --file .env.local

4. Deploy:
   toss deploy prod
```

Note: VPS provisioning requires root or passwordless sudo access.

## Deploy Flow

```
$ toss deploy prod

→ Acquiring lock...
→ Syncing files...
→ Applying dependencies...
→ Loading secrets...
→ Running deploy script
  $ npm ci
  $ npm run build
→ Starting service...
→ Configuring Caddy...
→ Releasing lock...

✓ https://prod.myapp.example.com
```

Without a custom domain:
```
✓ https://prod.myapp.64-23-123-45.sslip.io
```

### What Happens

1. Acquire deployment lock (prevents concurrent deploys)
2. Create a new timestamped release directory (e.g., `releases/20260130_143022`)
3. `rsync` files to the new release directory
4. Apply any missing server dependencies
5. Create symlinks for persistent directories (linking release → `preserve/`)
6. Merge secrets (base + overrides) into release directory as `.env`
7. Run `deployScript` commands in the release directory (aborts on first failure)
8. Atomically switch `current` symlink to the new release
9. Generate/update systemd unit file, reload systemd, restart service
10. Regenerate Caddy config and reload
11. Clean up old releases (keep N for prod, 1 for previews)
12. Release lock
13. Print URL

### Resiliency

The deploy flow is designed to be resilient to interruptions:
- Each step is idempotent (safe to retry)
- State is updated atomically where possible
- Locks have automatic timeout recovery
- Failed deploys leave clear error messages
- Re-running `toss deploy` after a failure will resume correctly

## Caddy Configuration

Caddy is configured with a single stable main file and one file per app.

### With Custom Domain

```
# /etc/caddy/Caddyfile
import /etc/caddy/caddy.d/*.caddy

# /etc/caddy/caddy.d/myapp.caddy
prod.myapp.example.com {
    reverse_proxy localhost:3000
}

pr-42.myapp.example.com {
    reverse_proxy localhost:3001
}

pr-123.myapp.example.com {
    reverse_proxy localhost:3002
}
```

Caddy handles SSL automatically via Let's Encrypt.

### Without Custom Domain (sslip.io)

When no domain is configured, toss uses [sslip.io](https://sslip.io/) for automatic DNS:

```
# /etc/caddy/Caddyfile (server IP: 64.23.123.45)
import /etc/caddy/caddy.d/*.caddy

# /etc/caddy/caddy.d/myapp.caddy
prod.myapp.64-23-123-45.sslip.io {
    reverse_proxy localhost:3000
}

pr-42.myapp.64-23-123-45.sslip.io {
    reverse_proxy localhost:3001
}
```

sslip.io provides wildcard DNS that maps any subdomain to the embedded IP address. This means:
- No DNS configuration required
- Works immediately after deploy
- Each environment gets a unique, shareable URL
- Caddy still handles SSL via Let's Encrypt

IPv6 is supported by replacing `:` with `-` and using only dashes:
```
prod.myapp.--1.sslip.io
staging.myapp.2a01-4f8-c17-b8f--2.sslip.io
```

## GitHub Actions

Generated by `toss init`.

If a domain is configured, preview URLs use `pr-<number>.<app>.<domain>`.
If no domain is configured, preview URLs use sslip.io (`pr-<number>.<app>.<ip>.sslip.io`).

## SSH Authentication

toss uses your existing SSH keys. No key management.

- Locally: Uses `~/.ssh/id_ed25519` or `~/.ssh/id_rsa`
- CI: SSH key stored in GitHub secrets

### Elevated Access Required

All toss operations require root or passwordless sudo access because they need to:
- Write to `/srv/<app>/` (system directory)
- Manage systemd services (`systemctl`)
- Edit `/etc/caddy/Caddyfile` and reload Caddy
- Install packages during provisioning (`apt-get`)

If SSH fails:

```
$ toss init

Server (user@host): root@64.23.123.45
Testing connection... ✗ Connection refused

Troubleshooting:
  1. Can you run: ssh root@64.23.123.45
  2. If not, copy your key: ssh-copy-id root@64.23.123.45
  3. Then try again
```

## Stateless Design

State is derived from the server:

- What envs exist? → Look at `/srv/myapp/*/` (excluding `.toss/`)
- What releases exist? → Look at `/srv/myapp/<env>/releases/`
- What's the active release? → Follow `/srv/myapp/<env>/current` symlink
- What ports? → Read `.toss/state.json`
- What dependencies applied? → Read `.toss/state.json`
- What should be routed? → Generate Caddyfile from state

## Ignore Defaults

rsync excludes:

```
node_modules
.next
.git
.env*
.DS_Store
```

## Full Example Workflow

### Initial Setup (once)

```bash
# 1. Init (sets up local files AND VPS)
toss init

# 2. Push your secrets
toss secrets push prod --file .env.local
toss secrets push preview --file .env.local

# 3. Commit
git add toss.json .github/
git commit -m "Add toss"
git push
```

### Daily Development

```bash
# Push to main → auto deploys to prod
git push origin main

# Open PR → auto deploys preview
# Preview URL commented on PR

# Merge/close PR → preview auto-removed
```

### Manual Deploy

```bash
toss deploy prod
toss deploy pr-42
```

### Manage

```bash
toss list                                  # see what's running
toss status                                # status summary (includes overrides)
toss logs prod                       # stream logs
toss logs pr-42 -n 100                     # last 100 lines
toss logs prod --since "1h"                # logs from last hour
toss ssh prod                        # SSH into current release dir
toss rollback prod                        # quick rollback to previous release
toss remove pr-42                          # remove preview
toss deploy pr-42 -s DATABASE_URL=...      # deploy with override
```

## What toss Doesn't Do

Intentionally excluded:

- Docker
- Kubernetes
- Multi-server / load balancing
- Database management (use your deployScript commands)
- Build caching
- Zero-downtime deploys

Keep it simple. One server, one app, just works.

## Tech Stack on Server

- **systemd** - process manager, restarts on crash, survives reboot (already on all Linux systems)
- **Caddy** - reverse proxy, auto-SSL, zero config

toss is runtime-agnostic. Your `deployScript` commands and server dependencies handle whatever runtime your app needs (Node.js, Bun, Python, Go, etc.).

## Future Considerations

Maybe later, maybe never:

- `toss exec <command>` - run command on server
- `toss doctor` - diagnose issues
- Multiple apps per config
- Monorepo support (`"root": "apps/web"`)
- Custom domain per preview
